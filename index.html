    <div><p>Syncretism</p></div>
    
   <div> <p>Syncretism is the combining of different, often contradictory beliefs, while blending practices of various schools of thought.
Syncretism involves the merger and analogizing of several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and
mythology of religion, thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths. Syncretism
also occurs commonly in expressions of arts and culture as well as politics.</p>

<p>Nomenclature, orthography, and etymology
The Oxford English Dictionary first attests the word syncretism in English in 1618. It derives from modern Latin syncretismus,
drawing on Greek συγκρητισμός, meaning "Cretan federation".
The Greek word occurs in Plutarch's essay on "Fraternal Love" in his Moralia . He cites the example of the Cretans, who
compromised and reconciled their differences and came together in alliance when faced with external dangers. "And that is
their so-called Syncretism".
Erasmus probably coined the modern usage of the Latin word in his Adagia, published in the winter of 1517–1518, to
designate the coherence of dissenters in spite of their differences in theological opinions. In a letter to Melanchthon of April
22, 1519, Erasmus specifically adduced the Cretans of Plutarch as an example of his adage "Concord is a mighty rampart".
Social and political roles
Overt syncretism in folk belief may show cultural acceptance of an alien or previous tradition, but the "other" cult may survive
or infiltrate without authorized syncresis nevertheless. For example, some Conversos developed a sort of cult for martyrvictims
of the Spanish Inquisition, thus incorporating elements of Catholicism while resisting it.
Some religious movements have embraced overt syncretism, such as the case of melding Shintō beliefs into Buddhism or the
amalgamation of Germanic and Celtic pagan views into Christianity during its spread into Gaul, the British Isles, Germany, and
Scandinavia. Indian influences are seen in the practice of Shi'i Islam in Trinidad. Others have strongly rejected it as devaluing
and compromising precious and genuine distinctions; examples of this include post-Exile Second Temple Judaism, Islam, and
most of Protestant Christianity.
Syncretism tends to facilitate coexistence and unity between otherwise different cultures and worldviews, a factor that has
recommended it to rulers of multi-ethnic realms. Conversely, the rejection of syncretism, usually in the name of "piety" and
"orthodoxy", may help to generate, bolster or authenticate a sense of uncompromised cultural unity in a well-defined minority
or majority. </p>

<p>Religious syncretism
Religious syncretism exhibits blending of two or more religious belief systems into a new system, or the incorporation into a
religious tradition of beliefs from unrelated traditions. This can occur for many reasons, and the latter scenario happens quite
commonly in areas where multiple religious traditions exist in proximity and function actively in the culture, or when a culture
is conquered, and the conquerors bring their religious beliefs with them, but do not succeed in entirely eradicating the old
beliefs or, especially, practices.
Religions may have syncretic elements to their beliefs or history, but adherents of so-labeled systems often frown on applying
the label, especially adherents who belong to "revealed" religious systems, such as the Abrahamic religions, or any system that
exhibits an exclusivist approach. Such adherents sometimes see syncretism as a betrayal of their pure truth. By this reasoning,
adding an incompatible belief corrupts the original religion, rendering it no longer true. Indeed, critics of a specific syncretistic
trend may sometimes use the word "syncretism" as a disparaging epithet, as a charge implying that those who seek to
incorporate a new view, belief, or practice into a religious system actually distort the original faith. Non-exclusivist systems of
belief, on the other hand, may feel quite free to incorporate other traditions into their own. Others state that the term syncretism
is an elusive one, and can be applied to refer to substitution or modification of the central elements of a dominant religion by
beliefs or practices introduced from somewhere else. The consequence under this definition, according to Keith Ferdinando, is
a fatal compromise of the dominant religion's integrity.
In modern secular society, religious innovators sometimes create new religions syncretically as a mechanism to reduce interreligious
tension and enmity, often with the effect of offending the original religions in question. Such religions, however, do
maintain some appeal to a less exclusivist audience. Discussions of some of these blended religions appear in the individual
sections below.
Ancient Greece
Classical Athens was exclusive in matters of religion. The Decree of Diopeithes made the introduction of and belief in foreign
gods a criminal offence and only Greeks were allowed to worship in Athenian temples and festivals as foreigners were
considered impure.
On the other hand, Athens imported many foreign cults, including those of Cybele and the Thracian goddess Bendis, and in
some cases this involved a merging of identities: for example, Heracles, who had traditionally been regarded as a mortal hero,
began here and elsewhere in the Aegean world to be identified as a divine figure, perhaps under the influence of Eastern
counterparts like the Tyrian Melqart.
Syncretism functioned as a feature of Hellenistic Ancient Greek religion, although only outside of Greece. Overall, Hellenistic
culture in the age that followed Alexander the Great itself showed syncretist features, essentially blending of Mesopotamian,
Persian, Anatolian, Egyptian elements within an Hellenic formula. The Egyptian god Amun developed as the Hellenized Zeus
Ammon after Alexander the Great went into the desert to seek out Amun's oracle at Siwa.</p>
